## What I Want to Learn In 2022

### More about operating systems
I want to learn more about operating systems and how they work, so I need
to get better at understanding the core concepts and systems used to build them.
For that I wan't to study more about Linxu. To do that I will first look at
how Serenety OS works, this OS a smaller project by the swede Andreas Kling which
will be easier to understand.

### Something else
