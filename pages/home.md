  <div class="hero-heading">Hello,</div>
  I am Alexander Mennborg a developer from Linköping, Sweden.
  Currently working as a Jr. Fullstack developer at Spotin in Luleå.
  And in my spare time I work on different hobby projects that are
  low-level in contrast to the kind of programming I do at work.

    ## At Home
    ### This website
    This website is generated with a simple C header library that I wrote which
    parses markdown and outputs tree DOM structure that is used to generate HTML.
    
    ### Compiler Development
    I took a course in Compiler Development and really liked it because you gain
    more insigt into
    
    ### Game Development
    I'm also interested in computer graphics and games, this is actually what got
    me into programming in the first place.
    
    ### Operating System Development
    I'm interrested in learning about operating system development because I think
    there is room for improvement with the current operating system.
    However creating a completely new OS is too big of a task for a hobby project.
    The goal is just to create some simple demo.
