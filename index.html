<div class="hero-heading">Hello,</div>
I am Alexander Mennborg a developer from Linköping, Sweden.
Currently working as a Jr. Fullstack developer at Spotin in Luleå.
And in my spare time I work on different hobby projects that are
low-level in contrast to the kind of programming I do at work.

<h1>What I Do</h1>

<h2>At Work</h2>
<h3>Full stack</h3>
<p>I currently work as a full stack developer which involes the entire tech stack.
Most of our codebase is not using any framework and is

</p>
<h2>At Home</h2>
<h3>This website</h3>
<p>This website is generated with a simple C header library that I wrote which
parses markdown and outputs tree DOM structure that is used to generate HTML.
</p>
<h3>Compiler Development</h3>
<p>I took a course in Compiler Development and really liked it because you gain
more insigt into
</p>
<h3>Game Development</h3>
<p>I'm also interested in computer graphics and games, this is actually what got
me into programming in the first place.
</p>
<h3>Operating System Development</h3>
<p>I'm interrested in learning about operating system development because I think
there is room for improvement with the current operating system.
However creating a completely new OS is too big of a task for a hobby project.
The goal is just to create some simple demo.

<h2>What I Want to Learn In 2022</h2>
<h3>More about operating systems</h3>
<p>I want to learn more about operating systems and how they work, so I need
to get better at understanding the core concepts and systems used to build them.
For that I wan't to study more about Linxu. To do that I will first look at
how Serenety OS works, this OS a smaller project by the swede Andreas Kling which
will be easier to understand.

<h3>Something else</h3>
<p>TODO
